# Benchmarks
- `run_naive`: insert random numbers into a set until it reaches the correct size
- `run_sample`: fill a vector and sample from it
- `run_sample_prealloc`: same as `run_sample` but only sample (for cases were a dedicated vector is initialized once and reused)
- `run_nunnu`: use the nunnu algorithm
- `run_nunnuOLD`: use an old version of the nunnu algorithm
